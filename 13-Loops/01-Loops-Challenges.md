# JavaScript Loops Challenges

## Easy Level

1. **Print numbers 1 to 10**  
   Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

2. **Print first 5 even numbers**  
   Use a `while` loop to print the first 5 even numbers.

3. **Print "Hello" 3 times**  
   Use a `do...while` loop to print "Hello" 3 times.

4. **Loop through an array with `for...of`**  
   Print all elements in the array `["red", "green", "blue"]`.

5. **Loop through object properties with `for...in`**  
   Print all keys and values of the object `{name: "Alice", age: 25}`.

6. **Print odd numbers from 1 to 15**  
   Use a `for` loop and print only odd numbers.

7. **Countdown from 10 to 1**  
   Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.

8. **Loop through a string using `for...of`**  
   Print each character of the string `"JavaScript"`.

9. **Sum numbers from 1 to 100**  
   Use a `for` loop to calculate and print the sum.

## Medium Level

1. **Break loop when number reaches 7**  
   Use a `for` loop that stops when `i` equals 7.

2. **Print multiplication table 1 to 5**  
   Use nested loops to print a 5x5 multiplication table.

3. **Find first number divisible by 13 between 100 and 150**  
   Use a `while` loop to find and print the number.

4. **Skip "banana" in array loop**  
   Loop through `["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]` and skip "banana".

5. **Print enumerable properties only**  
   Use `for...in` on an object with some non-enumerable properties.

6. **Print numbers 5 to 1 using `do...while`**  
   Use a `do...while` loop to count down from 5.

7. **Print only positive numbers from array**  
   Given an array, use a `for` loop to print positive numbers.

8. **Loop through Map with `for...of`**  
   Iterate over a Map object and print key-value pairs.

9. **Count vowels in a string**  
   Write a function that counts vowels using loops.

10. **Print star pattern**

    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```

3. **Break loop on low score**  
   Loop through an object of student scores, break if score < 50.

4. **Print pyramid pattern**  
   Use nested loops to print:

   ```
       1
      121
     12321
    1234321
   123454321
   ```

5. **Reverse a string**  
   Write a function to reverse a string using loops.

6. **Print only strings from mixed array**  
   Use `for...of` and `continue` to print strings only.
