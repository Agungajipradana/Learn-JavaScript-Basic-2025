# Learn JavaScript Basic 2025

Welcome to the **Learn JavaScript Basic 2025** repository!  
This project is a beginner-friendly guide to learning the fundamentals of JavaScript, one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world—especially for web development.

---

## 📘 Agenda

- 📌 Introduction to JavaScript
- 📌 Data Types
- 📌 Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- 📌 Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- 📌 Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- 📌 Functions
- 📌 And many more foundational topics...

Each section includes clear explanations and hands-on examples to help you learn by doing.

---

## 💻 Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (optional but helpful)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Agungajipradana/Learn-JavaScript-Basic-2025
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd learn-javascript-basic-2025
   ```

3. **Open the project in your code editor.**

   Each folder contains a README.md and JavaScript files that you can run in the browser console or using Node.js.

## 💡 Quick Tip: Use Quokka.js for Live JavaScript Feedback

To speed up your learning and see real-time results, install Quokka.js in Visual Studio Code.

- Open any .js file from this project.

- Use Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac), then run Quokka: Start on Current File.

- Modify the code and see immediate inline output without needing to reload or run manually.

Example:

```js
const greet = "Hello, Quokka!"; // Quokka shows: "Hello, Quokka!"
console.log(greet);
```

## 🎯 Learning Goals
