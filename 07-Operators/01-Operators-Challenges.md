# JavaScript Operators Challenges

## Easy Challenges (10)

1. Assign the value 10 to variable `x` using an assignment operator.

2. Add 5 and 3 using arithmetic operators and store the result in `sum`.

3. Check if 7 is greater than 5 using a comparison operator and store the result in `isGreater`.

4. Use logical AND to check if both `true` and `false` are true, store in `result`.

5. Increment the value of variable `count` by 1.

6. Decrement the value of variable `count` by 1.

7. Use ternary operator to assign `"Adult"` if `age >= 18`, else `"Minor"`.

8. Multiply 6 by 7 and assign the result to `product`.

9. Use the equality (`==`) operator to check if `'5'` is equal to `5`.

10. Use the strict equality (`===`) operator to check if `'5'` is strictly equal to `5`.

## Medium Challenges (10)

11. Combine two conditions using logical OR: check if `x` is less than 10 OR `y` is greater than 20.

12. Use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if 15 is divisible by 4.

13. Use nested ternary operators to assign grade based on `score`:

    - `score >= 90` → `'A'`
    - `score >= 80` → `'B'`
    - else `'C'`

14. Decrement a variable `z` by 2 using assignment operators.

15. Evaluate expression: `3 + 5 * 2` and explain the result with comments.

16. Use parentheses to change the result of `3 + 5 * 2` to 16.

17. Use a logical NOT operator to invert the boolean value of `isOnline`.

18. Check if variable `num` is NOT equal to 10 using a comparison operator.

19. Use increment operator inside a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

20. Use decrement operator inside a `for` loop to print numbers from 5 to 1.

## Hard Challenges (10)

21. Explain the output of:

    ```js
    let a = 5;
    console.log(a++);
    console.log(a);
    ```

    Add your explanation in comments.

22. Write an expression that uses multiple operators with different precedence, e.g.,  
    `10 + 20 / 5 * 2 - 3`, and explain the order of evaluation in comments.

23. Use a nested ternary operator to assign a string describing temperature:

    - `temp > 30`: `'Hot'`
    - `20 < temp <= 30`: `'Warm'`
    - else `'Cold'`

24. Use logical operators to check if a number is between 10 and 20 inclusive.

25. Write a complex expression combining assignment, arithmetic, and logical operators.

26. Explain the difference between `==` and `===` with examples in comments.

27. Write a program to simulate a simple login check using ternary operator:  
    If `isLoggedIn` is `true`, print `"Welcome!"`, else `"Please login."`

28. Use the comma operator to evaluate multiple expressions and return the last value.

29. Create a countdown from 3 to 1 using decrement operator inside a `while` loop.

30. Explain associativity by evaluating expression:
    ```js
    let val = 100 / 10 / 2;
    console.log(val);
    ```
    Add comments to show how it's evaluated step-by-step.
