# JavaScript Clean Code Challenges

## Easy Level

1. **Meaningful naming**
   Rename poorly named variables and functions so that the code clearly expresses its intent.

2. **Refactor large function**
   Break a function with more than one responsibility into smaller, reusable functions.

3. **Avoid magic numbers**
   Replace hardcoded numbers with named constants to improve code readability.

4. **Consistent formatting**
   Format code using consistent indentation, spacing, and braces.

5. **Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`**
   Refactor code that uses `var` to modern `const` or `let` based on mutability.

6. **Template literals over string concatenation**
   Convert string concatenations into template literals for cleaner syntax.

7. **Avoid deep nesting**
   Refactor nested `if` or loop structures to use early returns or guards.

8. **Use default parameters**
   Replace manual default values with ES6 default function parameters.

9. **Simplify conditionals**
   Refactor verbose `if-else` blocks into concise ternary expressions or logical returns.

10. **Use destructuring**
    Refactor object or array property access into ES6 destructuring.

## Medium Level

1. **Encapsulate logic in functions**
   Identify repeated blocks of logic and extract them into reusable functions.

2. **Reduce function parameters**
   Refactor functions that take too many parameters by passing a config object.

3. **Use array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)**
   Replace `for` loops with declarative array methods where appropriate.

4. **Separate concerns**
   Separate data transformation, business logic, and DOM manipulation into separate functions/modules.

5. **Use arrow functions**
   Refactor anonymous function expressions into arrow functions for cleaner syntax.

6. **Apply DRY principle**
   Eliminate repeated code by abstracting into reusable utilities.

7. **Add JSDoc comments**
   Add documentation to explain what a function does, including its parameters and return type.

8. **Use early returns**
   Refactor to reduce indentation and improve readability by using early returns.

9. **Use named exports**
   Instead of default exports, use named exports to improve discoverability and auto-imports.

10. **Implement error handling**
    Wrap risky code in `try...catch` and return meaningful error messages.

---

## Hard Level

1. **Refactor to a module pattern**
   Convert code into IIFE or ES module format with well-scoped public and private members.

2. **Build a clean configuration loader**
   Load and validate a config object using defaults, validation, and separation of concerns.

3. **Design a reusable utility**
   Create a reusable utility function (e.g., `capitalize`, `deepClone`, `debounce`) using clean code principles.

4. **Clean up legacy code**
   Take a poorly written block of legacy code and refactor it using modern best practices.

5. **Implement a logging module**
   Build a simple logger that encapsulates its configuration and exposes clean, modular methods.

6. **Organize large file into smaller modules**
   Break up a large file into smaller, organized, and reusable modules.

7. **Implement a formatter pipeline**
   Build a series of formatter functions that transform data in a clean, testable pipeline.

8. **Write testable functions**
   Refactor functions to be pure and inject dependencies so they are easier to test.

9. **Build a validation schema**
   Create a clean and reusable input validator using closures and separation of rules.

10. **Design with immutability**
    Refactor a mutable object flow to be immutable using `Object.assign()` or the spread operator.
